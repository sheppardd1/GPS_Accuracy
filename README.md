# GPS_Accuracy
## Purpose
Shows the accuracy value of the GPS readings according Android's built-in getAccuracy() function. 
This built-in Android function is not perfect, but tends to give decent approximations as to the the error 
radius of the GPS readings. More information about the getAccuracy() function can be found
